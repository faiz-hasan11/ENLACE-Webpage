The beauty of different cultures, whose colours are spread across the spectrum, have come together to create the laces of a majestic rainbow entangling splendidly into the ‘Enlace’, the cultural fest of IIIT Kottayam. 
Intrinsic to our existence, creating and strengthening bonds among people from different ethnicities is what this fest is all about. 
So when the ball drops, and the 'Enlace' spreads its wings splendidly into the sky, get ready to be enthralled and exhilarated by the aura of joy and astonishment that will be trapped inside your hearts for years to come.
"Where the sun rises from different directions, and light is yet the same; 
is where the diversity found beauty, the moon and the stars in a frame.
